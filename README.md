[**1.Back Propagation Implementation**](https://github.com/snehaNegi/DeepLearning-Hot-Topics/blob/main/1.%20Implementing%20Backpropagation) 


DataSet used: emotion_classification

**Our Task:**
The above dataset has training/test subject faces with happy/sad emotion are providedin the data. Each image is of 100Ã—100 matrix. 

a. Perform PCA to reduce the dimensionfrom 10000 to K= 12. 

b. Implement a 1 hidden layer deep neural network (layer containing10 neurons) to classify the happy/sad classes. Use the crossentropy error function with softmax output activations and ReLU hidden layer activations.

Perform 20 iterations of back propagation and plot the error on training data as a function of the iteration. What is the test accuracy for this case and how does it change if thenumber of hidden neuron size increased to 15. 

[Implement backpropagation by hand without using any tool].
